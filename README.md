# Multi-echelon Supply Chain Optimisation with Time Series and Network Modelling
A industrial attachment project on the topic of supply chain optimization using R package.
The multi-echelon model is used as a frame work to compute inventory optimisation parameters at each stages of the supply chain.
It is supported by a multiple time series model, developed based on ARIMA method, and capable of predicting demand at the SKU level 
- Machine Learning algorithms modelled includes GBM and LSTM 
A network model is also applied at the BoM level for computations and provides insights for operational improvements.
